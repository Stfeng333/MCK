        <p>
            Your smile, a sunrise, soft and bright,<br>
            chasing away the longest night.<br>
            its perfect curve, a tender grace,<br>
            bringing light to every space.<br><br>
            Your almond eyes, are clear and deep,<br>
            in their gaze, my heart takes a leap.<br>
            a universe within their glow,<br>
            a world of wonders I long to know.

    <div class="poem-right">
        <p>
            Your skin, so smooth, a silken landscape,<br>
            a masterpiece the heavens drew.<br>
            each touch of yours, a gentle fire,<br>
            kindling flames of sweet desire.<br><br>
            When you look into my soul,<br>
            the world feels steady, full, and whole.<br>
            no words can name this love I feel,<br>
            an unexplainable, sacred seal.<br><br>
            With every glance, with every smile,<br>
            you make this life worth its time.<br>
            my heart is yours, as it should beâ€”<br>
            for I am whole when you look at me.
